## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Application Architecture

#### 3.1.1 Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux for complex state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Visualization**: Recharts library for interactive charts

#### 3.1.2 Calculation Engine
- Modular design with separate calculation services for:
  - Core compound interest formulas
  - Tax calculations
  - Inflation adjustments
  - Monte Carlo simulations

#### 3.1.3 Data Requirements
- Historical market returns dataset (if implementing historical modeling)
- Inflation rate historical data
- Tax rate information by year (if implementing detailed tax modeling)

### 3.2 Core Algorithms

#### 3.2.1 Monthly Compound Interest Formula
```
FV = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + PMT Ã— [(1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1] / (r/n)
```
Where:
- FV = Future Value
- P = Principal
- r = Annual interest rate (decimal)
- n = Compounding periods per year (12 for monthly)
- t = Time in years
- PMT = Monthly contribution amount

> **Implementation Note**: This formula must be applied iteratively when contribution amounts change over time or when returns vary monthly.

#### 3.2.2 Inflation Adjustment
```
Real Value = Nominal Value / (1 + Inflation Rate)^t
```
Where t is the number of years from present.

#### 3.2.3 Monte Carlo Simulation
- Generate multiple return scenarios (1000+) based on expected return and standard deviation
- Calculate portfolio value for each scenario
- Derive probability distributions from results

### 3.3 Data Models

#### 3.3.1 User Input Schema
